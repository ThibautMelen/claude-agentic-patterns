    "tasks": ["task", "todo", "remind", "don't forget", "track", "checklist"],
    "research": ["find", "search", "look up", "research", "what is", "explain"]
}

def classify_intent(user_message):
    for intent, keywords in INTENT_PATTERNS.items():
        if any(kw in user_message.lower() for kw in keywords):
            return intent
    return "general"
```

## Example Interactions

### Calendar Request

```
User: "Schedule a meeting with Sarah tomorrow at 2pm"

🐔 Main Agent → 🚦 Classify → "calendar"
📚 Calendar Skill loaded
🔌 Google Calendar API → Create event

Response: "Meeting with Sarah scheduled for tomorrow at 2:00 PM.
I've sent an invite to sarah@example.com."
```

### Research Request

```
User: "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"

🐔 Main Agent → 🚦 Classify → "research"
📚 Research Skill loaded
🔌 Perplexity → Search and synthesize

Response: "Here are the latest developments in quantum computing:
1. [Finding 1 with source]
2. [Finding 2 with source]
